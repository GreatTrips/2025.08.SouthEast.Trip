    <!-- Chosen Palette: Vintage Blueprint -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The application uses an interactive timeline dashboard structure. A collapsible vertical navigation bar on the left allows instant navigation to any day. The main content is a vertical timeline where each day is a card. This preserves the chronological flow while adding a modern, space-saving navigation system. Key information, like the detailed "Dossiers," is hidden by default within expandable sections to keep the main view uncluttered. A version switcher at the top dynamically rebuilds the itinerary based on different travel themes (A, B, C). -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: 
    - Report Info: 15-day itinerary -> Goal: Organize/Navigate -> Viz: Vertical and Horizontal Timelines (HTML/Tailwind) -> Interaction: Click on a day in the vertical nav to scroll to the section -> Justification: Provides a clean, on-demand navigation experience.
    - Report Info: Columbia Dossier (text) -> Goal: Organize/Inform -> Viz: Expandable accordion section (HTML/JS) -> Interaction: Click a "View Dossier" button to reveal detailed text and a table -> Justification: Manages information density effectively.
    - Report Info: Building Heights (State House 180ft, BoA Plaza 388ft) -> Goal: Compare -> Viz: Styled HTML Table -> Interaction: None -> Justification: Replaces the bar graph with a clear, direct textual comparison of data as requested, focusing on readability.

                    title: "Columbia, South Carolina",
                    content: `<h4>Overview & Geography:</h4><p>The capital of South Carolina, Columbia is strategically situated in the state's geographic center on the <strong>Atlantic Seaboard Fall Line</strong>. This is a significant geological boundary where the hilly, clay-soiled Piedmont region descends to the flat, sandy Coastal Plain. This location is defined by the confluence of the Saluda and Broad rivers, which merge here to form the Congaree River. The rapids and waterfalls created by the Fall Line historically provided power for the city's early mills, making its location as much about industry as it was about politics.</p><h4>Distinguishing Skyline Features:</h4><p>Columbia's skyline is a modest but clear representation of its identity as a center for government and commerce.</p><ul><li><strong>South Carolina State House:</strong> The most historic and prominent landmark. Its wide, classical structure and <strong>180-foot</strong> copper dome are the heart of the city's profile. Built in the Greek Revival style, construction began in 1855 and continued for over 50 years, using blue granite quarried from the state itself.</li><li><strong>Bank of America Plaza:</strong> At <strong>388 feet</strong>, this 26-story tower is the tallest building in the city. Completed in 1989, its distinctive dark glass and stepped-back design represent the modern commercial growth of Columbia.</li></ul><h4>Etymology & Nicknames:</h4><p>Named in a 1786 legislative session for <strong>Christopher Columbus</strong>, representing a poetic, New World identity. Common nicknames include "The Capital of Southern Hospitality" and, more recently, "The Cola."</p><h4>Founding & Key Historical Events:</h4><p>Founded in 1786 as a planned city to be the new state capital. Much of the city was destroyed by fire during its occupation by Union forces in 1865. In 1917, Fort Jackson was established, now the U.S. Army's largest training installation.</p><h4>Economic & Demographic Profile:</h4><p>Population: ~139,000 | Metro Area: ~845,000. Major Industries: State Government, Education (University of South Carolina), Healthcare, Military.</p><h4>Culture, Cuisine & Architecture:</h4><p>Classic Southern comfort food is prevalent, with pimento cheese being a local staple. The Tunnelvision mural on Marion Street is a famous piece of public art.</p><h4>Government & Civic Structure:</h4><p>Columbia operates under a Council-Manager form of government.</p><h4>Notable People & Trivia:</h4><p>Small bronze stars on the west side of the State House mark where Union cannonballs struck the building in 1865.</p><h4>Chinatown:</h4><p>Unlike many major American cities, Columbia does not have a historically designated "Chinatown." While the city has a diverse and growing Asian-American population with numerous markets and restaurants scattered throughout the area, there was never a large, concentrated wave of Chinese immigration that established a distinct ethnic enclave.</p>`

It protects the largest remaining tract of old-growth bottomland hardwood forest in North America. This type of ecosystem once covered millions of acres but has now largely vanished.</p><h4>Ecology, Flora & Fauna:</h4><p>The park is a sanctuary for giant trees. Its old-growth forest contains one of the tallest temperate deciduous forest canopies in the world. Key species include colossal Loblolly Pines, towering Bald Cypress (identifiable by their flared trunks and \"knees\" that protrude from the water), and Water Tupelo. The park is an Important Bird Area, home to Barred Owls, Pileated Woodpeckers, and colorful Prothonotary Warblers.</p><h4>Creation & Purpose:</h4><p>Protected as a National Monument in 1976 and re-designated as a National Park in 2003 after a grassroots campaign in the 1960s saved the ancient forest from logging.</p><h4>Notable Metrics & Characteristics:</h4><p>The park covers 26,692 acres. The forest canopy averages over 100 feet in height, with some \"champion\" trees exceeding 167 feet. The main Boardwalk Loop Trail is 2.4 miles long.</p><h4>Trivia:</h4><p>This is not a swamp, but a dynamic river floodplain forest. It is a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve.</p>`

The rock walls are primarily Precambrian quartzite and granite gneiss, extremely hard metamorphic rocks that have resisted erosion and allowed the gorge to maintain its steep walls.</p><h4>Ecology, Flora & Fauna:</h4><p>The gorge's unique microclimates support unusual flora, including the very rare Persistent Trillium. The cliffs are a nesting site for reintroduced Peregrine Falcons.</p><h4>Creation & Purpose:</h4><p>The park was established in 1993 through a partnership between Georgia Power, which had operated a hydroelectric dam here since 1913, and the state.</p><h4>Cost:</h4><p>The original dam construction cost approximately $1 million in 1913.</p><h4>Notable Metrics & Characteristics:</h4><p>The park covers 2,689 acres. The gorge is 2 miles long and nearly 1,000 feet deep. The suspension bridge sways 80 feet above the gorge floor.</p><h4>Trivia:</h4><p>Before the dam, it was a major Victorian tourist attraction known as the "Niagara of the South." In 1970, Karl Wallenda successfully walked a high-wire across the gorge.</p>`

The Swan House, at the Atlanta History Center, was President Snow's mansion in *The Hunger Games*.</p><h4>Chinatown:</h4><p>Atlanta does not have a traditional, historic Chinatown. Instead, its vibrant Asian culture is concentrated along Buford Highway, a multi-lane corridor northeast of the city. Since the 1970s, this area has become a sprawling, authentic hub for dozens of nationalities, with a particularly strong presence of Chinese, Vietnamese, and Korean communities. You'll find countless restaurants, markets, and bakeries here. Additionally, the suburban city of Chamblee is home to the "Atlanta Chinatown Mall," a shopping center established in 1988 that serves as a cultural center for the Chinese community.</p>`
